# COFFEE-BUILDER

An algorithm creator and editor fully coded in Java that lets you use different components such as:

- Declaration
- Assignment
- Operation
- If
- While
- Output
- Input
- Comment
 
This program also gives you two different type of executions for your algorithm:

- AutoRun: The program executes everything alone without the need to press any other button besides START, you can also set a delay between the execution of the components
- Manual: After clicking the START button you can manually proceed with the step-by-step execution just by clicking the NEXT button

The program also has two views, one is the debug view which shows all current variables generated step by step by the algorithm through all assignments, declarations and operations;
the other one, Output, allows you to see all the program outputs via the OUTPUT component

You can also convert the graphical program to pseudocode or in a programming language like Java or Python.
